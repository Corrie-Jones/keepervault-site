1) GUIDED TOUR – SHORT SCRIPT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Welcome to KeeperVault. Before industries, we begin with the foundation: the Core Pillars.
These 46 systems support every operation in any sector. Choose what you need; we’ll add your industry layers after.

[Click Core Pillars → show 9 Rings.]

Start with Security:
• Cybersecurity (self-healing, zero API tether, continuous patching)
• Physical Security (perimeter, access control)
• Continuity (fail-safes, backup power; min 21-day requirement)

Open any pillar to see a short summary. Click “Details” for deeper bullets.
Everything here can operate online and offline. Originals remain on-site, immutable, and audit-ready.

Keys for assets:
For trucks, drones, aircraft, ships, ATVs/UTVs, satellites—each unit gets its own serialized Keeper Key. One key per unit, for life.

Requirements:
Biometric access at every point of entry, minimum USB fingerprint or existing biometric.
Power continuity required; we recommend at least 21 days so your operation stays secure through grid failures or disasters.

Legal assurance:
We protect privacy and comply with the law: copies on valid warrant only; originals sealed and unchanged; all transfers timestamped and logged.

Commercial model:
Custom build. Activation fee + annual maintenance for all plans (lease, lease-to-own, buy).
No partial systems—we deliver complete, sovereign deployments.

3) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (PLAQUE COPY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OFFLINE RECORD STORAGE — REQUIRED
Clients choose 1, 5, or 10 years of local, offline retention. Records remain accessible and protected even when the cloud fails.

BIOMETRIC ACCESS — REQUIRED
Minimum: a USB fingerprint scanner at every point of entry (or use existing enterprise biometrics). If KeeperVault supplies scanners, quantities must be declared; costs are included in the build quote.

POWER CONTINUITY — REQUIRED (21-DAY RECOMMENDED)
Backup may be generator, solar, wind, or battery. We recommend at least 21 days so your operation remains secure during grid failure or disasters (tornado, hurricane, earthquake). KeeperVault runs as long as your power runs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) KEYS FOR MOBILE/PHYSICAL ASSETS (PLAQUE COPY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
KEEPERVAULT KEYS SYSTEM — MANDATORY FOR MOVING ASSETS
Applies to trucks, drones, aircraft, ships, tanks, ATVs/UTVs, satellites, and any powered/controlled unit.

• One Key = One Unit (lifetime pairing; non-interchangeable)
• Asset-specific encryption & access control
• Prevents unauthorized ignition/control/data extraction
• Local continuity + telemetry protection (offline capable)
• Neighborhood Watch linkage for patches and lockout, live or via offline sync
• Serialized to unique hardware IDs; replacements require re-auth & new serial

Example: 100 drones = 100 Keys, each uniquely configured.

Tour line: “These Keys are not universal. One key, one unit — for life.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) SOFTWARE CONTROL & LICENSING PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose
Ensure all third-party and open-source tools in KeeperVault are legal, stable, secure, and offline-capable.

Scope (examples)
• Office suites (e.g., WPS Office; LibreOffice as fallback)
• Medical imaging/diagnostic viewers
• CAD/blueprint tools (engineering/aviation)
• Encryption & secure comms suites
• Analytics/reporting engines
• Any specialty licensed software required by operations

Policy
a) Pre-Licensing & Activation — KeeperVault pre-licenses & activates before delivery. License counts map to biometric access points.
b) Cost Integration — License fees included in build quote; renewals via annual maintenance. Clients don’t manage third-party licenses.
c) Deployment Mode — Tools run portable/self-contained in the Vault environment (no invasive installs/registry sprawl).
d) Update Control — Auto-updates & telemetry disabled. Version bumps ship via verified KeeperVault releases only.
e) Fallbacks — Open-source or internal fallback is preinstalled for each licensed tool. Automatic switch if needed—no downtime.
f) Hardware Parity — Biometric scanner count = authorized terminals; internal ledger tracks license allocation for perfect audit.
g) Industry Modules — Certified tools (HIPAA/FAA/etc.) handled identically under this protocol.

Client Assurance
“KeeperVault manages and maintains all software licensing within its systems. You receive a complete, compliant environment — locked, secure, and ready — without added admin burden.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) LEGAL & COMPLIANCE (PLAQUE COPY)

Procedure
• Copies provided only upon valid legal warrant.
• All disclosures are timestamped, dated, and logged at transfer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) COMMERCIAL MODEL (PLAQUE COPY)
